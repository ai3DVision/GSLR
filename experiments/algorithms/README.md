# Algorithmic Experiments and Benchmarks

This directory contains subdirectories corresponding with each algorithmic appraoch we attempted.

The two main approaches we tried were our own (GSLR) and L1-Regularized Logistic Regression ("The LASSO") from [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/).

We also tried L2-regularized logistic regression, the classic PCSF setup, and the "Graph LASSO" / "Structured Regression Incorporating Graphical structure among predictors" (SRIG).
