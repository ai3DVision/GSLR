# Experiments with Graph-Sparse Logistic Regression

### `./KEGG`

Contains notebooks we used to download and preprocess the KEGG pathway database, as well as the resulting database as a pandas dataframe.

### `./data_generation`

Contains 5 semi-synthetic data generation strategies' notebooks, scripts, and explanations.

### `./generated_data`

Contains the generated data in csv format. This is listed in the `.gitignore` so you likely don't see it!
Please feel free to request access, or generate the data yourself via the `./data_generation` directiory.

### `./algorithms`

Contains the experimental code to test each of the algorithms we tested against the generated semi-synthetic data.
